# TEI

The Yellow Wallpaper is a story about mental illness.

Before actually encoding the text, I had to get familiar with it. I used the "suggest edits" feature in Google Docs to annotate different parts of the text. My goal in doing this was to keep all my notes clear and separate from the text. As you can see in the picture above, this mode shows the suggested edits in green text, as well as making a box on the right that shows each edit. The edits can be removed or marked as acknowledged from this box.

For the most part, the text I was assigned was fairly straightforward. There were several strange spaces, a couple of underlined words, and a change of word choice in one or two places. The only issue I had with this part was getting used to the author's writing style. The author had a tendency to mix T's and H's whenever they were next to eachother, which made a shape that looked like a capital N with a line coming off of it. There was also one word that I got caught on later on, pictured below. It looks like it says "the bargain", but there is a tail on the 'b' and a part coming off the 'g' that are both crossed out. What kind of mistake was this? Could it be a word other than "bargain?" "gartain?" Perhaps "curtain?"

Once the text was annotated, it was time to start coding it into TEI. Before I had started editing the Google Doc, I copied and pasted the text into the "body" section of a blank TEI manuscript file. I did it this way to avoid leaving extra comments I could forget to remove later. In retrospect, I think it would have been better to copy and paste one line or paragraph at a time, as I still had to search for things I was missing.

The rest of the process was straightforward, as I had clear instructions and good guidelines to make sure I had marked everything that I needed to. I really enjoyed this assignment, it was interesting and it helped me wet my feet in XML/TEI code. Part of me wishes I had a more complicated part to code, but then again, this was perfect. I got a very balanced set of features to code in.
