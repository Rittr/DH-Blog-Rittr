# Six Degrees of Francis Bacon

**Project Director:** Christopher Warren

**Project URL:** http://sixdegreesoffrancisbacon.com/

A dynamic, interactive tool to study the humanities.


This website aims to connect everyone connected to Sir Francis Bacon, up to 6 degrees. It is a collaborative effort to show and find the connections between early modern historical figures. _Six Degrees_ aims to document and visualize the connections in the humanities during the 16th and 17th centuries. Upon visiting the website, the user will first see a graph of interconnected nodes. These nodes represent people, and the lines connecting them represent relationships. The central node is Sir Francis Bacon himself. Those that have worked with him are in the "first degree", and people who have worked with them are in the "second degree". This goes on to reach six degrees, but the graph only shows three degrees at a time.

 _Six Degrees_  was created with Angular, Ruby, and D3. The website gives you several options to browse the data. The nodes will show more information when clicked on, as well as their own connections. At the bottom of the page, there are groups of people that you can switch between viewing. The option to switch to a "contribute" mode, in which you can add your own nodes to the graph, is also present.

The website takes a while to load and seems pretty buggy. It crashed several times while I was using it and exploring it, but it is very interesting to look at. There are options to customize and change the layout of the graph to see individual parts or connections better. A better landing page would help the website a lot, as the unloaded website can look very confusing. A more accessible tutorial, landing page, or even an introductory text box would have helped with first impressions.

I am impressed by how immediately accessible the "contribute" feature of the website was. It reinforces the idea that this is a tool for those studying humanities, more than a simple interactive map of relationships. The website requires a login before you can add people or connections to it. Once logged in, it will allow you to add anyone you want, provided the connection is accurate. For each connection, there is a percentage that shows how confident the website is that the two people had met or interacted in some way. A chart showing a simple timeline of their lives is also present. This chart shows how long the two were both alive for and how much of that time intercepts. That is, it shows the period in which they were both alive and could have met. This helps rule out people that never could have met, or that would have been very young when the other was old. If there is a historical record of meeting or working together, it confirms the relationship. These relationships receive a 100% confidence rating. This system lets the graph and dataset continue growing and expanding.


'Six Degrees of Francis Bacon' is a dynamic, interactive, constantly updated dataset. It can be a useful shared resource for those trying to piece together social connections in the time of Francis Bacon. The dynamic nature of the website can cause the graph to change often. This is why the creators recommend including the date when citing its data. Although there seem to be some issues with the responsiveness of the website, there is a lot to learn from it.
