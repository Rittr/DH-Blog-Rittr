# Six Degrees of Francis Bacon

**Project Director:** Christopher Warren

A dynamic, interactive tool to study the humanities.


This website aims to connect everyone connected to Sir Francis Bacon, up to 6 degrees. It is a collaborative effort to show and find the connections between early modern historical figures, specifically those connected in some way to Sir Francis Bacon, and everyone connected to them, and so on, six times.


_Six Degrees_ is a project with the goal of documenting and vizualizing the connections in the humanities world throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. Upon visiting the website, the user is greeted by a graph of interconnected nodes. These nodes represent people, and the lines connecting them represent relationships.

The website is built with Angular, Ruby, and D3. The website gives you several options to browse the data, as well as giving the option to switch to a "contribute" mode, in which you can add your own nodes to the graph.

The website takes a while to load and seems pretty buggy. It crashed on me a few times, but it is very interesting to look at, and there are options to customize and change the layout of the graph to see individual parts or connections better. I believe that a better or improved landing page would help the website a lot, as it can be confusing to see all these bubbles with blank name boxes while it takes a while to load. A tutorial, landing page, or even an introductory text box, would have helped first impressions to the website a lot.

I was impressed by how immediately accessible the "contribute" feature of the website was. It reinforces the idea that this is meant to be used as a tool by those studying humanities, and not just an interactive map of relationships. The website requires a login before you can add people or connections to it, but otherwise will allow you to add anyone you want, provided the connection is historically accurate. There is also a percentage associated with each connection that shows how confident the website is that they had met or interacted in some way. along with a chart showing a simple timeline of their lives, and how long the two were both alive for, and how much of that time intercepts, that is, the period in which they were both alive and could have met. This helps rule out people that never could have met, or that would have been very young when the other was old. -A 100% confidence rating is given only to those that have a record of their meeting or collaboration.-

'Six Degrees of Francis Bacon' is a dynamic, interactive, constantly updated dataset. It can be an extremely useful shared resource for those trying to piece together social connections in the time of Francis Bacon. While the dynamic nature of the website can cause the layout and composition of visualizations to change frequently, (which is why the creators recommend including the date whenever data is cited) Although there seem to be some issues with the responsiveness of the website, with patience, there is a lot that can be learned from it.
