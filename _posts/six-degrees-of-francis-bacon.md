This website aims to connect everyone connected to Sir Francis Bacon, up to 6 degrees. It is a collaborative effort to show and find the connections between early modern historical figures, specifically those connected in some way to Sir Francis Bacon, and everyone connected to them, and so on, six times.

The website takes a while to load and seems pretty buggy, it crashed on me a few times, but it is very interesting to look at, and there are options to customize and change the layout of the graph to see individual parts or connections better. I believe that a better or imporved landing page would help the website a lot, as it can be confusing to see all these bubbles with blank name boxes while it takes a while to load. I think a tutorial, landing page, or even just an introductory text box, would have helped first impressions to the website a lot.
