## -Brief Summary

IL DIVINO is a virtual reality experince that lets you see Michelangelo's work on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel up close, from the same scaffolds that were used to paint them. It includes a guided tour that will highlight different parts of the room and tell the stories of each of them

## -Assess Humanistic claims and technology

The nature of Virtual Reality makes this experience of the Sistine Chapel incredibly interactive

IL DIVINO was made using the Unreal Engine - the same game engine behind Fortnite and many of the visuals in The Mandalorian.

## -Identify interesting, outstanding or problematic issues

The guidance of the tour was excellently designed, and it was easy to learn about any specific detail on the cieling. The most glaring issues I encountered were more technical. For example, whenever a certain section was being talked about in the narration, one or more spotlights would shine on the part in question. Sometimes these spotlights would cause stuttering in the video, which can cause serious discomfort in VR.\*

Another dissappointing issue was the lack of any options or settings menu. Although some parts were inexplicably demanding on my computer, there were many times that I wished it would take more advantage of my PC. The resolution was low, with no post-processing to soften the edges of lines, making them seem blocky and pixelated. These are settings that tend to be present in other VR applications, and they should even be easily supported by the Unreal engine.

Besides performance, the only other issue I noticed was that the cherry picker that can be used to see the art up close can only move freely in one half of the chapel. The 'basket' of the cherry picker is clearly connected to the rest of the machine, and the other half of the chapel is separated by a half-wall. While I understand this decision to protect the realism, I am dissappointed that only half the paintings can be observed up close.

These nitpicks really are just that, though. IL DIVINO is probably one of the best ways to experience and learn about the sistine chapel, doing things that could definitely not be done in real life, such as seeing the building from the scaffolding that Michelangelo himself used.

\*I think this stuttering was caused by using dynamic lights instead of baked lighting; something that's easier to set up but very performance intensive
