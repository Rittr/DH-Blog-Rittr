## -Brief Summary

IL DIVINO is a virtual reality experience that lets you see the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel up close. It lets you see the chapel from different perspectives, such as the scaffolds it was painted from. It includes a guided tour that will highlight different parts of the room and tell the stories of each of them. This VR experience allows you to see the ceiling from views that few people have ever seen in real life. The project shows Michelangelo's personal experience in painting the chapel's ceiling. It also tells the story of what is being shown in each painting.

## -Assess Humanistic claims and technology

There are two main stories that this project covers:  the story told by the art and the story of the artist. Once the guided tour ends, you are free to point at any section of the wall or ceiling and hear an explanation of it. After the first explanation, you can choose the same piece again for more details. As a section is being explained by the narration, a spotlight will shine on any part that is being mentioned. 

The guided tour starts by explaining many of the difficulties that Michelangelo faced as he worked in the chapel. Later on, it gives you the option to stand on the same scaffolds that he worked from. Here you see the process that he went through as he was painting, as well as a letter describing his challenges.

The nature of Virtual Reality makes this experience of the Sistine Chapel incredibly interactive. The project requires a PC VR headset and a decent computer to run it.

IL DIVINO was made using the Unreal Engine - the same game engine behind Fortnite and many of the visuals in The Mandalorian.

## -Identify interesting, outstanding or problematic issues

The guidance of the tour was well designed, and it was easy to learn about any specific detail on the ceiling. The most glaring issues I encountered were more technical. For example, whenever a certain section was being talked about in the narration, one or more spotlights would shine on the part in question. Sometimes these spotlights would cause stuttering in the video, which can cause serious discomfort in VR.\*

Another disappointing issue was the lack of any options or settings menu. Although some parts were inexplicably demanding on my computer, there were many times that I wished it would take more advantage of my PC. The resolution was low, with no post-processing to soften the edges of lines, making them seem blocky and pixelated. These are settings that tend to be present in other VR applications, and they should even be easily supported by the Unreal engine.

Another issue was that the cherry picker that can be used to see the art up close can only move freely in one half of the chapel. The 'basket' of the cherry picker is clearly connected to the rest of the machine, and the other half of the chapel is separated by a half-wall. While I understand this decision to protect the realism, I am disappointed that only half the paintings can be observed up close.

These nitpicks really are just that, though. IL DIVINO is one of the best ways to experience and learn about the Sistine chapel. It does things that would be impossible in real life, like showing the scaffolding that Michelangelo himself used.

\*I think this stuttering was caused by using dynamic lights instead of baked lighting; something that's easier to set up but very performance intensive.
