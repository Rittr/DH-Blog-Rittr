# Grant Reflection

Over the past few weeks I have been working on a grant proposal for a Virtual Reality Digital Humanities project. The idea for the project was inspired by a part of the last DH project I reviewed, _IL DIVINO: Sistine Ceiling in VR_. As part of its guided tour it explained how it took four whole years for Michelangelo to paint the sistine chapel, and how he basically had to learn how to paint, as he was mainly just a sculptor before. This makes it sound like it was a piece that took an exceptionally long time to paint, but then it showed the _Mona Lisa_ in front of you, with perfect proportions, and explained that this same painting also took four years to make.

Unfortunately I wasn't able to get a screenshot of this part of the tour, and I doubt it would translate well to a flat image anyway (it's surprisingly hard to give the same sense of scale on a 2D screen as in VR), but using photoshop and some quick math, I put together these pictures to show how different the scale between the two is. First is the _Mona Lisa_ compared to _The Creation of Adam_, probably the most easily recognized part of the Sistine Chapel.

A considerable difference already, but that's only a part of what Michelangelo painted! This is a picture of the _Mona Lisa_ compared to the entirety of the ceiling, but keep in mind that there is even more that wraps around the top part of the walls in the Chapel too!

Even with the rest of the project being amazing, this size comparison is the part that stuck with me the most. When the time came to decide on a project for the grant proposal, I wanted to see if I could do more of what _IL DIVINO_ did with this part of their tour.

The idea was to make a sort of "Virtual Art Gallery" that would show you several well known artworks in their true size and proportions, to help give more perspective into how these paintings actually look in real life. It was a very bare-bones plan with a lot of gaps to fill in, but the meeting with Dr. Stover is where it first really started to take shape.

I have a whole page of notes from what we talked about there, but to me the most important takeaway was this: don't just make it VR to make it VR, have a reason why it _has_ to be in VR. This really made me lean into some of what I was talking about above more, and with this (and some other more logistical things) in mind I started fleshing out my project idea as I did some research.

Virtual art galleries are not a new idea, (most of the research I found about it was conducted between 1990 and 2005!) and there are a lot out there that already are great, for example, a tour of a virtual gallery of Vincent Van Gogh's art (which you can find [here](https://vrallart.com/vr-exhibitions/em/vincent_van_gogh/)), but they all fall short of what I wanted to do. For example, very few are truly in Virtual Reality. And many of them, VR or not, don't take advantage of being digital.
